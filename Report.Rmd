# Roles

The two primary aspects of the role a pitcher has is when they are put into the game, and how long they are expected to go. For this exercise, I created a couple of variables to help contextualize the latter: pitches per appearance and outs per appearance. In terms of game situation for when a pitcher is called in, the Leverage Index is the best place to look. In order to get a sense of the types of roles that managers had for pitchers, I performed a cluster analysis with these three variables. 

## Starter
  
Before even looking into the data, I thought of considering a 'front-end starter' a different role from a 'back-end guy.' After all, there can be slight differences in expectations of those two distinctions. Some number 4/5 start are purely innings-eaters who are expected to go as long as possible in order to save as much of the bullpen as possible. Giving guys rest and winning games are two different goal. However, I decided that the position of a starter is much more team context than anything else. The Opening Day starter of a rebuilding team may only be a 3/4 or even the fifth guy in a World Series Contending team. With that being said, I stuck with outs per game, pitches per game and game leverage index because it would keep the starters in all one cluster. The actual duration of a 'successful' starter is different based on who you ask, so the simple goal of a starter is to pitch as long as possible while giving their team the best chance at winning. Ideally, this would be 6+ innings, success for a starter coming back from injury or a guy getting his call from AAA does not always mean 6 innings. I will more precisely define what success actually looks like for a starter, but the first pitching role I will consider is starting pitcher.

## Reliever

So the obvious next role is relief pitcher, which is indicated in the data. However, the usage of pitchers after their starter is where we see the most variation. This ties back into my cluster analysis, which helps answer two main questions that can help establish a pitching role. First, how many outs is a guy expected to get. Yes, this is very dependent on the game situation, but, on average, how many outs/pitches is a guy giving the team. Second, when is this pitcher being inserted in a game. Even though two pitchers may be expected to pitch one inning, does the innings or game situation that they are brought into help explain their role. The cluster analysis just based on the three variables will not be perfect. However, I used it as a starting point to see what kind of guys were grouped together to see if any sort of 'role' stuck out. In order to allow for the most clusters within relievers, I increased the number of clusters until the 'starter' cluster was broken into two, since it will be considered one for this exercise. In the end, there were 4 non-starter clusters, but each of these clusters do not end up representing a unique role.

### High-Leverage Reliever

As an avid roto fantasy baseball player, the singular most important role of a reliever is the closer. However, giving closer it's own role seems unfair. There are 7th inning guys who would close on other teams, and closers who would find themselves pitching in much different situations for other, more-competitive teams. Instead, I will use the term high-leverage reliever. Among the 4 clusters, 2 clusters featured guys fitting this role. These are guys who pitch late in games, especially close ones, and are expected to go 3 innings. This is not to say they will not be called upon 4 and 5 out outings every once in a while, but the primary expectation for these guys is to start and finish the innings, and that's it.
