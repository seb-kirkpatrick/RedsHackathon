# Roles

The two primary aspects of the role a pitcher has is when they are put into the game, and how long they are expected to go. For this exercise, I created a couple of variables to help contextualize the latter: pitches per appearance and outs per appearance. In terms of game situation for when a pitcher is called in, the Leverage Index is the best place to look. In order to get a sense of the types of roles that managers had for pitchers, I performed a cluster analysis with these three variables. For these clusters, I required a minimum of 15 games and 25 innings pitched. These cutoffs are both arbitrary, but the goal is to get pitchers who have pitched enough to actually be in an established role. 

## Starter
  
Before even looking into the data, I thought of considering a 'front-end starter' a different role from a 'back-end guy.' After all, there can be slight differences in expectations of those two distinctions. Some number 4/5 starters are purely innings-eaters who are expected to go as long as possible in order to save as much of the bullpen as possible. Giving guys rest and winning games are two different goals. However, I decided that the position of a starter is much more team context than anything else. The Opening Day starter of a rebuilding team may only be a 3/4 or even the fifth guy in a World Series Contending team. With that being said, I stuck with outs per game, pitches per game and game leverage index because it would keep the starters in all one cluster. The actual duration of a 'successful' starter is different based on who you ask, so the simple goal of a starter is to pitch as long as possible while giving their team the best chance at winning. Ideally, this would be 6+ innings, success for a starter coming back from injury or a guy getting his call from AAA does not always mean 6 innings. I will more precisely define what success actually looks like for a starter, but the first pitching role I will consider is starting pitcher.

## Reliever

So the obvious next role is relief pitcher, which is indicated in the data. However, the usage of pitchers after their starter is where we see the most variation. This ties back into my cluster analysis, which helps answer two main questions that can help establish a pitching role. First, how many outs is a guy expected to get? Yes, this is very dependent on the game situation, but, on average, how many outs/pitches is a guy giving the team. Second, when is this pitcher being inserted in a game? Even though two pitchers may be expected to pitch one inning, does the innings or game situation that they are brought into help explain their role. The cluster analysis just based on the three variables will not be perfect. However, I used it as a starting point to see what kind of guys were grouped together to see if any sort of 'role' stuck out. In order to allow for the most clusters within relievers, I increased the number of clusters until the 'starter' cluster was broken into two, since it will be considered one for this exercise. In the end, there were 7 non-starter clusters, but each of these clusters did not end up representing a unique role.

### High-Leverage Reliever

As an avid roto fantasy baseball player, the singular most important role of a reliever is the closer. However, giving closer it's own role seems unfair. There are 7th inning guys who would close on other teams, and closers who would find themselves pitching in much different situations for other, more-competitive teams. Instead, I will use the term high-leverage reliever. Among the 4 clusters, clusters 1, 2 and 3 contained pitchers that fit this role. These are guys who pitch late in games, especially close ones, and are expected to go 3 innings. This is not to say they will not be called upon 4 and 5 out outings every once in a while, but the primary expectation for these guys is to start and finish the innings, and that's it. 

### Multi-Innings Reliever

Unlike the single-inning reliever, multi-innings guys are much rarer. Within the clusters, we see the majority of these guys in clusters 4, 5, and 6. The reason for the differentiation in clusters is based on the game situation. In Cluster 4, for example, every pitcher has an outs per appearance above 3, yet they all have very low average leverage indexes. The easy answer for this is that these guys pitch in games where the start has been pulled early or there is little to no chance of winning. Essentially, cluster 4 is the guys that soak up innings. Cluster 5 and 6 have higher leverage indices, so those are the guys who are asked to get the starter to the high leverage guys. Some of these relievers, though they are asked to pitch multiple innings, face very high leverage situations. In these instances, guys like this find themselves in the first 3 clusters, but have a much higher outs per game and pitches per game. The moral of the story is that multi-innings pitchers vary a lot. For this exercise, we will focus on guys who are asked to get to a high-leverage guy, whether it be pitching the 5th and 6th inning, or even the 7th and 8th. These are the guys who can fill in for an injured starter, but may not be expected to go 6. In most situations, these guys will be deployed when the starter falls short of 5 innings. This group will be the main candidates for guys who may see more success in the 'starter' role.

### The Rest

The long relievers were not the only type of pitchers in clusters 4, 5 and 6. There were also many single innings guys who held a very low average leverage index. Those guys hold similar duration expectations to the high-leverage role, but are put into games that are not as competitive. For example, maybe the long innings guys are tired, or the starter made it 5 innings and the team needs someone to get to the 7th where a higher-leverage guy can come in. This role, though, rather than being defined by having characteristics, is more defined by the lack of skill. These are the guys that fill out the rest of the bullpen. While this role will not be one I look to describe success for, as it is nearly identical to success for high-leverage arms, it will be a primary source of individuals who maybe have the characteristics of another role, but have not been given the opportunity in the last 3 years.

# Success

Before I can start to analyze what characteristics lead to success, I first have to define what success is in each role. I touched on it in general terms in the role descriptions, but I will talk about the specific metrics and statistics that I will be using to judge a pitcher's success. There is a lot of talk about description versus prediction and which estimators are better than others. For this, a key measure will be ERA-.How well did a pitcher keep runs off the boards. ERA may not predict future success as well as something like FIP, but for categorizing success in terms of winning is all about scoring more than your opponent. For starters, I will look at WAR. For High Leverage arms, I will look at shutdowns as well as the percentage of scoreless innings. Long-Innings relievers will be judged similarly, but looking at WPA since they often come in lower leverage situations. 

## ERA Minus

The old adage is that you have to throw 3 viable pitches to be a starter. Well, to test this theory with ERA minus, I found the percentage thrown of the top 5 pitches for each pitcher and saw if the percentage was in any way correlated with ERA-. Not a single one of the correlation coefficients was over +/- 0.1. This does not necessarily mean that how much you throw a pitch is not related to ERA-, just that just percentage of each of a players top pitches does not help tell us how successful of a pitcher they were. I then turned to the Stuff+ of these pitches.
